    "### A NOTE ON FUTURE EXTENSIONS TO THIS RESEARCH \n",
    "\n",
    "* As of March, 2021, a collaborative research project is currently being developed to extend the bivariate VECM model with a Markov Switching Autoregressive model for the VIX, combined with some GARCH model variations (E.G. GJR-GARCH / E-GARCH) for forecasting volatility in the CDS/STOCK series. The aim is to test whether incorporating current and forecasted volatility and the current regime level of the VIX into the bivariate VECM (CDS/BONDS) models has any predictive power in forecasting future asset prices; with a particular focus on testing whether 'supposed' the earlier price discovery mechanism of CDS contracts will be able to provide predictive power in this model on future stock prices\n",

    "### THESIS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \n",
    "* According to financial theory, both CDS and bonds are linked by their relationship in measuring credit risk. Moreover, the theory of no-arbitrage pricing would sugest that both markets price credit risk equally- as reflected by their prices- otherwise, opportunities risk-free arbitrage profits would arise. In practice, there are a multitude of factors which lead to market frictions that can prevent this so-called 'equilibrium' or no-arbitrage state from persisting. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The existing body of research, supported by underlying economic theory would suggests that this equilirium state of the two asset prices should be cointegrated. This idea will be tested by utilising a sample size far greater than any previous paper; furthermore, the sample size will be long enough to incorporate both the global financial crisis and the euro-zone crisis. Thus, the dynamics of the CDS-bond relationship can be empirically tested over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* This empirical testing will be done by examining if a cointegrating relationship exist between the CDS and BOND for a particular firm. If the presence of this cointegrating relationship is confirmed, a vector error correction model (VECM) will be applied and subsequent price-discovery speed mechanisms (introduced in the relevant section) calculated to determine the underlying dynamics of each series. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * Where no cointegration is found, the series can be used to perform a vector autoregression (VAR) and test the causality through a Granger causality test; however, this mechanism is unable to conclude the price discovery or adjustment mechanisms, but will provide an outline of causality through the predictive power of (p) lags on the current price.

    "    * Alternatively, this could be some form of data error, although the median basis also confirms negative basis for health-care at the same times. This would warrant a more detailed, specific inspection of this sector's data. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Additionally, we see high flucuations in the mean basis for transportation (with a large spike around 2015); although, this effect is less pronounced in the median- thus, the effect of a large outlier should be inspected before drawing any conclusions. \n",
    "\n",

One noteworthy observation is that the effect is significantly more pronounced for typically \"riskier\" industries, E.G. Technology, Financials and less pronounced for typically safer sectors E.G. Consumer Staples: which appears to be virtually unaffected. \n",

Drawing upon the aforementioned sectors above, the more typically \"safe\" asset classes have a long-run median which is closer to zero (E.G. consumer staples, capital goods) VS. more typically volatile sectors (E.G. Consumer Cyclical, Financials): which have consistently higher bases, as well as exhibit greater volatility. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Identifying potential breakpoints is important, otherwise the VAR and VECM regression models will assume the changes are happening in continuous time, when in reality the large changes have actually transpired over months/years. This is because the date index not being continuous will be ignored by the packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  To illustrate this point visually, a single GVKEY (1045) will be shown below to demonstrate why a structural break would have a severe impact on the results. \n",
    "   \n",
    "1) Visually, it is apparent there is some break occuring 2011 to 2012\n",
    "\n",
    "2) This is resulting in an abnormally high (group-by) standard deviation, but if you were to isolate just the first section/regime (that is, before the structural break) the true standard deviation for each of the two sections is much lower in reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) The following question remains: should some of the data be discarded? Should the VAR/VECM models be conducted seperately on each regime? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SIDE NOTE: \n",
    "<p>As a side note, the variation in the 2nd regime of the CDS is a continuous flat line (repeated values of 5456.22)-  which is likely representative of another problem with liquidity. (When there is no trades for any given trading day, that days value is either missing (which would result in another structural break depending on how many consecutive days were missed) or, the most recent trade's value is interpolated/duplicated to fill it in). This was chosen as the method for this paper, and in most peer papers, rather than discard the data alltogether. <p\n"

That is to say, the sample variance of some (K-period) future return: y<sub>t</sub> - y<sub>t-k</sub> is indeed (K) times the sample variance of the singular period return. Thus, the VR ratio at some lag (K) is subsequently defined as the ratio between the (1/K)th of that (K) period return to the variance of the initial, one-period return.

    "* CDS leadership in the price discovery process remains strong (relative to the full VECM sample)\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, the contribution of bonds increased markedly in the HAS measure in the after period VS. the before period -- which offers someinsight into the bond's share of price discovery contribution in the HAS measure from the full-model (where BOND price discovery leadership portion is substantially lower than the after sub-sample here)\n",
    "    * This is especially visible in traditionally more stale sectors (E.G. Consumer Staples) in both the full model and after-subsample\n",
    "* The higher degree of cointegration evidence in the after-subsample is an interesting observation, at first glance it is consistent with the idea that regulatory changes post GFC / Eurozone crisis may have had an impact on the CDS-BOND basis dynamics; whereby, the tightening of CDS regulation reduced the market's perception of the market relative to the more traditionally stable bond market. \n",

Thus, winsoring upper or lower extreme variables will not affect the conclusion regrding whether (E.G.) firms with a higher degree of BOND price discovery leadership in credit risk generally are firms with high R&D to sales ratios vs. firms with low R&D sales ratios have their credit risk first discovered in the CDS market. \n",

Thus, in the latter case, information pertaining to credit risk with the higher possibility of default is being first discovered in the CDS market. \n",

    "    * This generally favours the idea that when the BOND series leads, there may be other factors (E.G. aggregate market conditions, firm capitalisation, credit quality) which mean the BOND series has distinct regimes in which it leads the price discovery process VS. CDS which is more volatile in this regard\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* This idea is further reinforced by the large number (217) of joint VIX / STOCK CLOSE rejections on CDS; meaning these variables may have a large degree of inter-causality.\n",
    "* The (45) rejections of VIX on stock should be examined more closely -- see graph below\n",
    "    * As below, there are a reasonable number of exceptions by sector; most importantly, the bulk of the rejections are occuring in consumer staples, which tends to be a \"safer\" stock sector in times of higher volatility. This could partially explain the number of rejections of VIX on stock closing prices"
