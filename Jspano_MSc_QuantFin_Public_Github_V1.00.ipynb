One noteworthy observation is that the effect is significantly more pronounced for typically \"riskier\" industries, E.G. Technology, Financials and less pronounced for typically safer sectors E.G. Consumer Staples: which appears to be virtually unaffected. \n",

Drawing upon the aforementioned sectors above, the more typically \"safe\" asset classes have a long-run median which is closer to zero (E.G. consumer staples, capital goods) VS. more typically volatile sectors (E.G. Consumer Cyclical, Financials): which have consistently higher bases, as well as exhibit greater volatility. "

Largely, this error is caused by some sort of \"explosive\" data change in one variable E.G. the cds-spread, while the bond values do not change (not because credit risk is unaffected in bonds, but because the chance of default has become so apparent that no one has been able to sell the bond and update the relevant market prices. Thus, the bond price reflects the credit conditions of several time periods past). It is cumbersome to do so, but finding quoted market prices for those days would likely correct the errors. Alas, this data is not available without heavy expense and thus cannot be incorporated. </p>"
