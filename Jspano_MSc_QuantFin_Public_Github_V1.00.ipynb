    "    * contains all bond trades between 2002 and June-2017\n",

    "    * contains bond ID, cusip_id, sub-product type, debt-type, issuer_name, maturity date, grade, convertible_flag, company_symbol\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) Third data point is Bond Coupon Rates,  a .txt file from (Mergent FISD), pertaining to coupon information per bond\n",

One noteworthy observation is that the effect is significantly more pronounced for typically \"riskier\" industries, E.G. Technology, Financials and less pronounced for typically safer sectors E.G. Consumer Staples: which appears to be virtually unaffected. \n",

Drawing upon the aforementioned sectors above, the more typically \"safe\" asset classes have a long-run median which is closer to zero (E.G. consumer staples, capital goods) VS. more typically volatile sectors (E.G.
