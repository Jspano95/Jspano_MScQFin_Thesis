One noteworthy observation is that the effect is significantly more pronounced for typically \"riskier\" industries, E.G. Technology, Financials and less pronounced for typically safer sectors E.G. Consumer Staples: which appears to be virtually unaffected. \n",

Drawing upon the aforementioned sectors above, the more typically \"safe\" asset classes have a long-run median which is closer to zero (E.G. consumer staples, capital goods) VS. more typically volatile sectors (E.G.
