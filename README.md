The main file which contains the entire stylized notebook is: Jspano_MSc_QuantFin_Public_Github_V2.00
This notebook has been designed to condense months of research into an easily digestable process that outlines all the steps taken for my own thesis work, as well as the additional research work done under Dr. T. Ladika, regarding arbitrage trading / fixed income markets research.
